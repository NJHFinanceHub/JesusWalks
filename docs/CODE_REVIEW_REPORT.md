# Code Review Report (UE5)

This report covers only the Unreal Engine 5 codebase in `unreal/TheNazareneAAA`.

## Review standard
- Gameplay code must be implemented in UE5-compatible language/tooling.
- New systems should be authored with C++, Blueprint, config `.ini`, and Unreal content assets.
- Deprecated prototype-language scripts are not part of the supported runtime.

## Follow-up
Run code review and QA against UE5 modules under `Source/TheNazareneAAA` and content in `Content/`.
