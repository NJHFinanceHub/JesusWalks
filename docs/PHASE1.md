# Phase 1 (UE5 Foundation)

## Delivered baseline
- Unreal project bootstrap and module structure
- Core gameplay framework classes
- Input, camera, and campaign bootstrap in UE5 runtime

## Rule
All implementation language for gameplay must remain UE5-compatible (C++/Blueprint and Unreal-native assets).
