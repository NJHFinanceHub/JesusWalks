# Plot: The Nazarene

**Migration note (February 6, 2026):** This narrative spec is engine-agnostic. Production implementation should assume Unreal Engine 5 as the active runtime target.

This document defines a storyline centered on the **known life of Jesus in the canonical Gospels** (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John). The game uses stylized action-RPG systems, but mission beats should track Gospel chronology and themes rather than fictional alternate-history arcs.

## Narrative guardrails
- Keep the main campaign focused on Jesus’s earthly ministry: incarnation, ministry, passion, resurrection, and commission.
- Treat combat encounters as symbolic/spiritual resistance, not as historical claims that Jesus led military campaigns.
- Prioritize teachings, mercy, healing, prayer, and sacrificial love as progression drivers.
- Use non-Gospel material (Torah, Prophets, Epistles, Revelation) as theological context, visions, or epilogue—not as timeline replacements for Jesus’s life.

## Gospel-aligned campaign arc
1. **Birth and early revelation** (Luke 1–2; Matthew 1–2)
   - Annunciation, nativity, shepherds/magi, and temple dedication establish identity and mission.
2. **Baptism and wilderness testing** (Matthew 3–4; Mark 1; Luke 3–4)
   - Baptism affirms sonship; wilderness episode frames obedience and resistance to temptation.
3. **Galilean ministry** (Matthew 5–13; Mark 1–6; Luke 4–9)
   - Calling disciples, Sermon on the Mount themes, healings, exorcisms, and parables.
4. **Signs, compassion, and identity revelation** (all four Gospels)
   - Feeding miracles, storm-calming, and mercy toward outcasts reinforce the kingdom ethic.
5. **Journey to Jerusalem** (Luke 9–19; parallel passages)
   - Intensifying teaching on discipleship, humility, prayer, and repentance.
6. **Passion week** (Matthew 21–27; Mark 11–15; Luke 19–23; John 12–19)
   - Triumphal entry, Last Supper, Gethsemane, trial, crucifixion, and burial.
7. **Resurrection and commission** (Matthew 28; Mark 16; Luke 24; John 20–21; Acts 1)
   - Empty tomb, resurrection appearances, restoration of disciples, and mission to the nations.

## Prototype chapter mapping (current 4-region flow)
- **Chapter 1 — Galilee Shores:** early public ministry, deliverance, and compassion.
- **Chapter 2 — Decapolis Ruins:** mercy extending beyond familiar boundaries.
- **Chapter 3 — Wilderness of Temptation:** fidelity to the Father under testing.
- **Chapter 4 — Jerusalem Approach:** movement toward passion-week culmination.

## Theological framing for gameplay systems
- **Prayer mechanics:** model dependence on the Father.
- **Miracle mechanics:** emphasize healing, restoration, and signs of the kingdom.
- **Morality/choice systems:** reward mercy, humility, truthfulness, and forgiveness.
- **Endgame tone:** victory through sacrifice and resurrection hope, not domination.

## Ending promise
The campaign should close with resurrection hope and commissioning: Jesus is risen, the kingdom is proclaimed, and players are invited into a life shaped by love, faithfulness, and service.
