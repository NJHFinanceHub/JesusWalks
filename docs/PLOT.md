# Plot: The Nazarene

**Migration note (February 6, 2026):** This narrative spec is engine-agnostic. Production implementation should assume Unreal Engine 5 as the active runtime target.

This document defines a storyline centered on the **known life of Jesus in the canonical Gospels** (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John). The game uses stylized action-RPG systems, but mission beats should track Gospel chronology and themes rather than fictional alternate-history arcs.

## Narrative guardrails
- Keep the main campaign focused on Jesus’s earthly ministry from incarnation to crucifixion, ending at Golgotha with reverent tone.
- Treat combat encounters as symbolic/spiritual resistance, not as historical claims that Jesus led military campaigns.
- Prioritize teachings, mercy, healing, prayer, and sacrificial love as progression drivers.
- Use non-Gospel material (Torah, Prophets, Epistles, Revelation) as theological context, visions, or epilogue—not as timeline replacements for Jesus’s life.

## Gospel-aligned campaign arc
1. **Birth and early revelation** (Luke 1–2; Matthew 1–2)
   - Annunciation, nativity, shepherds/magi, and temple dedication establish identity and mission.
2. **Baptism and wilderness testing** (Matthew 3–4; Mark 1; Luke 3–4)
   - Baptism affirms sonship; wilderness episode frames obedience and resistance to temptation.
3. **Galilean ministry** (Matthew 5–13; Mark 1–6; Luke 4–9)
   - Calling disciples, Sermon on the Mount themes, healings, exorcisms, and parables.
4. **Signs, compassion, and identity revelation** (all four Gospels)
   - Feeding miracles, storm-calming, and mercy toward outcasts reinforce the kingdom ethic.
5. **Journey to Jerusalem** (Luke 9–19; parallel passages)
   - Intensifying teaching on discipleship, humility, prayer, and repentance.
6. **Passion week** (Matthew 21–27; Mark 11–15; Luke 19–23; John 12–19)
   - Triumphal entry, Last Supper, Gethsemane, trial, crucifixion, and burial.
7. **Crucifixion and burial** (Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; John 19)
   - Golgotha, the cross, and burial conclude the playable campaign with solemn reflection.

## Prototype chapter mapping (current 7-chapter flow target)
- **Chapter 1 — Bethlehem Nativity:** annunciation context, birth of Christ, and early worship scenes.
- **Chapter 2 — Jordan Baptism:** John the Baptist, repentance call, and public commissioning.
- **Chapter 3 — Wilderness Testing:** obedience under temptation.
- **Chapter 4 — Galilean Ministry:** disciples, teachings, healings, and compassion beats.
- **Chapter 5 — Journey to Jerusalem:** discipleship, humility, and kingdom preparation.
- **Chapter 6 — Passion Week:** supper, Gethsemane, betrayal, and trial.
- **Chapter 7 — Golgotha:** crucifixion and burial as the campaign finale.

## Theological framing for gameplay systems
- **Prayer mechanics:** model dependence on the Father.
- **Miracle mechanics:** emphasize healing, restoration, and signs of the kingdom.
- **Morality/choice systems:** reward mercy, humility, truthfulness, and forgiveness.
- **Endgame tone:** victory through sacrifice and resurrection hope, not domination.

## Ending promise
The campaign should close at the crucifixion and burial with a reverent, prayerful epilogue that points players toward hope without turning the ending into a shooter-style victory beat.
